## A convenient application for publishing recipes. # ### After registration, the user has the opportunity to enter data in his profile (change photo, write name, personal information, change e-mail and password). Registered and logged in user can publish posts that are displayed on the main page of the project. Posts can be viewed in detail and liked. It is also possible for the user to change the password if he has forgotten it, when logging in. In this case, a link will be sent to the mail, by which you can create and use a new password.
